Let $X \sim \text{Geom}(\frac{1}{13})$ be the number of non-aces before the
first
ace. Then, $\text{E}(X) = 13$.

Let $Y \sim \text{NHGeom}(4, 48, 2)$ be the number of non-aces before the second
ace is drawn. Then, $\text{E}(X) = \frac{rb}{w+1} = \frac{2*48}{5} = 19.2$

Let $Z = Y - X$. Notice that $Z$ represents the number of non-aces between the
first and the second ace. $\text{E}(Z) = \text{E}(Y) - \text{E}(X) = 19.2 - 13 =
6.2$.
