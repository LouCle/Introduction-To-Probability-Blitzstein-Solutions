Let $I_{j}$ be the indicator variable for $j$-th card being red. Let $R_{j} =
I_{j}I_{j+1}$ be the indicator variable for the $j$-th and $j+1$-st cards being
red. Let $X = \sum_{j=1}^{51}R_{j}$ be the number of consecutive red pairs in a
well shuffled deck of 52 cards. Then, $$\text{E}(X) = \text{E}(\sum_{j=1}^{51}R_
{j}) = \sum_{j=1}^{51}\text{E}(R_{j}) = \sum_{j=1}^{51}\frac{\binom{26}{2}}{
\binom{52}{2}} = 51\frac{\binom{26}{2}}{\binom{52}{2}}$$
