Let $C_{1}$ be a random chord that spans a minor arch of length $x$ on a circle
of radius $r$. To generate a chord $C_{2}$, with endponts $A$ and $B$, such that
$C_{2}$ intersects $C_{1}$, either $A$ is on the minor arch and $B$ is on the
major arch, or $A$ is on the major arch and $B$ is on the minor arch.

Let $I_{x}$ be the indicator variable for $C_{2}$ intersecting $C_{1}$ when the
minor arch generated by $C_{1}$ has length $x$.
Then, $P(I_{x}=1) = 2\frac{x}{2\pi*r} * \frac{2\pi*r - x}{2\pi*r}$. 

Since the length
of the minor arch $x$ generated by $C_{1}$ can span from $0$ to $2\pi*r$,
we integrate $P(I_{x}=1)$.

$$\frac{1}{2\pi*r} \int_{0}^{2\pi*r} \! 2\frac{x}{2\pi*r} * \frac{2\pi*r - x}
{2\pi*r} \, \mathrm{d}x  = \frac{1}{3}.$$
