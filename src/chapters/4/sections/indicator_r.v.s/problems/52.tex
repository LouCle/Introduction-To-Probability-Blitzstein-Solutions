Let $I_{j}$ be the indicator variable for the $j$-toss landing on an outcome
different from the previous toss for $2 \leq j \leq n$. Then, the total number
of such tosses is $X = \sum_{j=2}^{n}I_{j}$. The total number of runs
is $Y = X + 1$. Since $\text{E}(X) = \sum_{j=2}^{n}P(I_
{j}=1) = \sum_{j=2}^{n}\frac{1}{2} = \frac{n-1}{2}$, $\text{E}(Y) = \frac{n-1}
{2} + 1 = \frac{n+1}{2}$.
