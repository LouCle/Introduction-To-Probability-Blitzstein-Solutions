Let $I_{j}$ be the indicator random variable for $j$-th person drawing the slip
of paper containing their name.

Let $X = \sum_{j=1}^{n}I_{j}$ be the number of people who draw their name. Then,
by
linearity of expectation,
$\text{E}(X) = \text{E}(\sum_{j=1}^{n}I_{j}) = \sum_{j=1}^{n}\text{E}(I_{j}) =
\sum_{j=1}^{n}\frac{1}{n} = 1$.
