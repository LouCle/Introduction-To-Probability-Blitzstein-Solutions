\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Let $I_{j}$ be the indicator variable that $j$ person in Bob's sample is
also sampled by Alice. Then, $P(I_{j}=1) = \frac{1}{10}$. Then, the expected
number of people in Bob's and Alice's samples is $2$.

\item $|A \cup B| = 100 + 20 - |A \cap B| \implies \text{E}(|A \cup B|) =
100 + 20 - \text{E}(|A \cap B|) = 100 + 20 - 2 = 118$.

\item Let $I_{j}$ be the indicator random variable for couple $j$ being in Bob's
sample. Then $P(I_{j}=1) = \frac{\binom{998}{18}}{\binom{1000}{20}}$. Thus, the
expected number of couples in Bob's sample is $\text{E}(X) = 500\frac{
\binom{998}{18}}{\binom{1000}{20}} \approx 0.2$.
