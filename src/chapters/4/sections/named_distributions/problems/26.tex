\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Let $Z$ represent the number of flips until both Nick and Penny flip
Heads. Then is $Z \sim \text{FS}(p_{1}p_{2})$, since Nick's and
Penny's flips are independent. $\text{E}(Z) = \frac{1}{p_{1}p_{2}}$

\item The logic is analogous to part $a$, but success probability is $p_{1} + p_
{2} - p_{1}p_{2}$.

\item $$P(X_{1} = X_{2}) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}(((1-p)^{2})^{k-1}p^{2}) = 
\frac{p}{2-p}$$

\item By symmetry, $$P(X_{1} < X_{2}) = \frac{1-(\frac{p}{2-p})}{2} = \frac{1-p}
{2-p}$$
\end{enumerate}
