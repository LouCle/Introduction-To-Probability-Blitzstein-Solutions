Suppose $w = r = 1$. The white ball is equally likely to be any of the $w+b$
balls. Also, note that the event {\it $k$-th drawn ball is the white ball } is
equivalent to the event {\it $k-1$ black balls are drawn until the white ball is
drawn}. Thus, for $X \sim \text{NHGeom}(1, n-1, 1)$, $P(X = k) = P(k+1\text{-th
drawn ball is white}) = \frac{1}{n}$ for $0 \leq k \leq n-1$.

$P(X = k) = \frac{\binom{1+k-1}{1-1}\binom{1+n-1-1-k}{1-1}}{
\binom{1+n-1}{1}} = \frac{1}{n}$
