\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item This is not possible, since $Y$ has a non-zero probability of being a
number larger than $100$, where as $X$ is capped at $100$.

\item Let $X$ be the number of contestants who enter a tournament, and let $Y$
be the number of contestants who pass the first round. Clearly, $P(X \geq Y) =
1$.

\item This is not possible, because if $X$ always produces values smaller or
equal to the values produced by $Y$, then $\text{E}(X) \leq \text{E}(Y)$.
However, $\text{E}(X) = 90$, and $\text{E}(Y) = 50$.
