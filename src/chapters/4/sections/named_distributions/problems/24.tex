One way to think about the problem is that the event $X < r$ counts all
sequences of $n$ independent Bernoulli trials, where the number of failures is
larger than $n - r$. If we
extend the number of trials indefinitely,
this implies that more than $n - r$ failures occured before the $r$-th success,
because otherwise, we'd have $X \geq r$. The probability of this event is $P(Y
> n - r)$. 

Implication in the reverse direction can be shown analogously.
