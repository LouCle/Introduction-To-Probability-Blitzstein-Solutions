Let $I_{j}$ be the event that the $j$-th person in the sample is picked
exactly once. 

Let $X = \sum_{j=0}^{1000}I_{j}$ be the total number of people that
are sampled once. Since $P(I_{j}=1) = (\frac{10^{6}-1}{10^{6}})^{999}$,
$\text{E}(X) = \sum_{j=0}^{1000}P(I_{j}=1) = \sum_{j=0}^{1000}
\frac{10^{6}-1}{10^{6}}^{999} \approx 999$. Thus, the expected number of
people sampled more than once is $1$.

Let $Z \sim \text{Poiss}(1)$ approximate the number of people sampled more than
once. Then, $P(\text{a person is sampled more than once}) \approx P(Z > 0) = 1 -
e^{-1} \approx 0.63$.
