Note that $31 = 2^{4} + 2^{3} + 2^{2} + 2^{1} + 1$. Thus, Martin can play at
most $5$ rounds. For every possible win, Martin makes $1$ dollar. If the game
reaches the fifth round, it is also possible that Martin loses and walks away
with nothing.

Let $X$ be Martin's winnings.

Then,

$$\text{E}(X) = \sum_{i=1}^{5}(\frac{1}{2^{i}} 1) + (\frac{1}{2^{5}}
0) \approx 0.97$$
