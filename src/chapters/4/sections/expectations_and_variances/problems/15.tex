\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Let $X$ be the earnings by player $B$. Suppose $B$ guesses a number $j$
with probability $b_{j}$. Then,

$$\text{E}(X) = \sum_{j=1}^{100}jp_{j}b_{j}$$

To maximize $\text{E}(X)$ then, $B$ should set $b_{j} = 1$ for the $j$ for which
$jp_{j}$ is maximal. Since $p_{j}$ are known, this quantity is known.

\item Suppose player $P(A=k) = \frac{c_{A}}{k}$, and $P(B=k) = b_{k}$. Then,

$$\text{E}(X) = \sum_{k=1}^{100}(k\frac{c_{A}}{k}b_{k}) = c_{A}$$.

Thus, irrespective of what strategy $B$ adopts, their expected earnings are the
same, so $B$ has no incentive to change strategies. Similar argument can be made
for $A$.

\item part $b$ answers this part as well.
