\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item The expected number of children in a randomly selected family during a
particular era is $\text{E}(X) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}k\frac{n_{k}}{\sum_{k=0}^
{\infty}n_{k}} = \frac{m_{1}}{m_{0}}$.

\item The expected number of children in the family of a randomly selected child
is $\text{E}(X) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}k\frac{kn_{k}}{\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}kn_{k}} =
\frac{m_{2}}{m_{1}}$.

\item answer in part $b$ is larger than the answer in part $a$. Since the
average in part $a$ is taken over randomly selected families, families with
fewer children are weighted the same as families with more children. The average
in part $b$, on the other hand, is taken over individual children, skewing the
weights in favor of families with more children.
